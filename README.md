## Project Overview üéä
<h6> Mini Shop is a project in Java, Spring Boot, Angular, H2, and Docker creating an online wine store. The system helps in the functioning of the web application related to the sale and shipment of wines in the demo version, placed on the server, and accessible via a web browser. The basic function of the system is to enable a new potential user to create their own account and access it without leaving home, where they will be able to quickly search for a specific product from the wine list, check its price, find out about its production, and order it at the address of their choice. </h6>

## UML Diagrams üìà
<h4> Use case diagram </h4>
<h6> A use case diagram is a UML diagram that shows us in the form of scenarios how a system or software interacts with individuals, organizations, or external systems carried for the purposes of this diagram the name of actors. It transmits how the actor uses the system to achieve a specific goal. It doesn't implement details, attributes, and user values. Without an actor, creating a use case diagram would be impossible as the main goal is to show how to use the system. Thus, it allows you to designate programmer, the goals that a given software user will want to achieve. These diagrams are used to supplement more detailed documentation. In this case, it shows how a potential user or a person with an already-created account can look for, add, delete products to their cart update, leave review of bought wines on the website, inquire about shipment and payment on Mini-Shop. </h6>



<h4> Class diagram </c4>
<h6> A class diagram is a UML diagram that is considered by many to be one of the most useful diagrams because it allows us to reproduce the structure very precisely specific system. A class diagram uses information about its class for this purpose,
attribute, operation, and relations between them, e.g. class: wine, attribute: sweetness, acidity, tannin or alcohol, and the operation will be some activity, e.g. shipment of wine. The shape construction of this diagram is divided into three rows and is in the form of a rectangle. The top row contains information about the class name, the middle one tells us about the class's attributes and the bottom row has pieces of information about the methods or operations that the class can perform. We must also remember that classes also have access modifiers, they are visible only to e.g. network administrator or for all users, depending on which symbol we choose ( Public (+) or Private (-)). In our project, we have e.g. class name as the user, attributes are id, name, surname, e-mail, nick, and the operations are login and sign. </h6>



<h4> Activity diagram </c4>
<h6> An activity diagram is a UML diagram that is used to model activities and scope responsibility of system components or users. It is otherwise known as an interaction diagram. Its primary function is to show the sequence of steps. These steps are performed by the modeled part of the system. It shows in the form of elements the behavior of the system, but where, the most important element is the activity. In this way, it shows the behavioral aspects of our system by using activities that the user, administrator, or server performs. The activity diagram was created by using: https://www.visual-paradigm.com. </h6>



## System architecture üóº
<h4> C4 diagram </h4>
<h6> C4 level model diagram stands for context, containers, components, and code. It is a diagram that shows a hierarchical set of software architecture and is a great tool for communicating the planning process of a software system. Mini-shop project is being created using many programming languages and technologies. The backend of the application is being implemented in Java. Spring Framework is responsible for the business side of the system and enables double-sided communication with the H2 database.
Connection with server follows with REST API architecture style. The web application is being created using the JavaScript Framework - Angular mainly with use of TypeScript </h6>
